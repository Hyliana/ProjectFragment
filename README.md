# Project Fragment

> [!WARNING]
> This is a poor example of my coding abilities, from an era well before I learned good form and best practices. If you're here because you looked at my resume (and are evaluating my skills), I gently beg you: please look at a different repository. I can't be held responsible for what High School me did.

# About Project: Fragment

*A dialog-rendering engine prototype for GameMaker Studio (not Studio 2).*

## Context

### What
Project Fragment was a concept for a game some friends and thought up the day we graduated high school.

### Why
As a youth I loved programming using GameMaker 7 and GameMaker 8. This happened to still be in my account, so I decided to archive it in honor of an era gone by.

### When
2016, The day I graduated high school.

### How
About a year before I graduated high school I wanted to recreate the typewriter effect used in the opening of Metroid 3. I repurposed my previous work for this.
