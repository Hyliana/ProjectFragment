# About Project: Fragment

*A dialog-rendering engine prototype for GameMaker Studio (not Studio 2).*

## Context

Project Fragment was a concept for a game some friends and thought up the day we graduated high school. About a year before, I had wanted to recreate the typewriter effect used in the opening of Metroid 3. Seeing an opportunity, I repurposed my previous work for this. 

Here's the thing, it's not pretty. This github account was created because I wanted to learn how to use Git for this project. That's half the reason this project is being left up: in honor of that stage of my life. I figured it might be fun to give it a good sendoff and prepare this repo for archival. 

If you're interested in seeing how I did things before I knew how stuff SHOULD be done, knock yourself out. I've since learned that it's fantastic to learn by example, and seen a couple dozen other implementations of similar features. This was my uneducated attempt to recreate what I had seen with what I knew. For what it is, I'm kinda proud of it. Anyway, time to lock this bad boy. 

## What next?

Check out the rest of my github. Worst that can happen is you realize you have better things to do, right?
